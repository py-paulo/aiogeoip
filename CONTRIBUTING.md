If you want to contribute by implementing a new feature, fixing a bug,
redoing some of the code, etc. you must follow the following conventions:

* Functions with an average level of complexity upwards should contain a brief description.
* The functions must contain a ``type hit`` of the parameters and returns.
* There should be tests in ``unittest`` or doctest for routine.
* Must meet the standard ``pylint`` and ``flake8``.
* Names of variables and functions in **lower case** separated by ``_``.
* Classes with **capitalized case**.

We appreciate your interest in contributing and improving this library :smiley:
